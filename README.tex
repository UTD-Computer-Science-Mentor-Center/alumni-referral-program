\section{Disclaimer}\label{section:disclaimer}

You are not guaranteed an interview let alone a job offer. At the bear minimum,
you are only guaranteed 1 person looking at your resume.

If at any point you provide your contact information outside the confines of
this program, you are responsible for any messages and/or spam you
receive.\label{section:disclaimer:spamMessages}

\section{Participation Requirements}

\subsection{Requester}

\currentBoss{} asked to set the minimum number of semesters worked at the
CSMC to be eligible for the program at \minSemesters{} semesters.

\subsection{Referrer}

Requirements are still a work in progress.

For now, it is only former CSMC mentors; however, this is what you would more
likely call ``guidelines'' than actual rules.

\section{Opt-in Process}

\subsection{Requester}

At some point \currentBoss{} should have posted Pratik Bhusal's referral request form. Assuming you are eligible, please fill that form
out to show your interest in the program.

\subsection{Referrer}

Notify Pratik Bhusal know that you no longer want to give referrals.

\note{%
    As mentioned in the \hyperref[section:disclaimer:spamMessages]{disclaimer},
    if you provide your contact information to a requester, you are responsible
    for any communication that does not go through this program.
}

\note{%
    Special conditions may exist based on the referrer's preferences and/or
    restrictions. These conditions will be mentioned in the provided list.
}

\note{Referral requests will come at a first come first serve basis.}

\note{%
    In the situation that a company on that list has multiple potential
    referrers, one will be randomly picked.

            Why can't you just post all the referrers' contact information in the
            primary method of communication used by the CSMC (e.g: Slack)?
        }
        {%
            The referrer has only guaranteed sharing contact information with
            Pratik Bhusal. Them receiving unsolicited spam from a random
            individual should never happen.
